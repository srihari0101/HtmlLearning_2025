What I Learned:

Colors: I figured out how to pick colors using those weird codes like #FF0000 for red.
Card Sizes & Images: I learned that making the cards taller or shorter also moves the pictures around inside them.
Image Links: I learned that you have to use the exact link to the picture or it wont work.
Making Cards: I learned how to make the cards do stuff when you click on them, like change how they look.
Web Page Tricks: I learned about all these things you can do to make web pages look and act different, like how to space things out, make them move smoothly, and position them exactly where you want.
